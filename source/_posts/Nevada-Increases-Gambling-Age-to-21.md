#  Nevada Increases Gambling Age to 21

Nevada gambling regulators voted unanimously on Tuesday to raise the minimum age to 21 for casino gaming, bingo and lottery tickets in the state. The new regulation will take effect January 1st, 2019.

The move underscores a growing trend among states to protect their gambling industries from younger people who may be more prone to developing gambling addictions. Massachusetts is also looking at raising its gambling age from 18 to 21.

State gaming officials estimated that the new rule could reduce annual gaming revenue by as much as $50 million, but they said it was necessary to protect vulnerable members of society.

“It’s not about lost revenue, it’s about protecting citizens,” said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) supported the decision, saying that it would help to “protect consumers and promote responsible gaming practices”.

Some casino operators were less enthusiastic about the change, arguing that it would make it harder for them to compete with casinos in other states. Boyd Gaming Corporation, which operates 27 casinos in Nevada, said that it was disappointed with the decision and that it would lead to job losses in the state.

The decision is likely to be controversial, but there is strong evidence that increasing the minimum age for casino gambling can help to protect young people from developing harmful addictions.

#  Nevada Raises Gambling Age in Response to Complaints

The Nevada state government has announced that it is raising the gambling age from 18 to 21 in response to complaints from parents and other concerned citizens. The decision was made by the state’s Gaming Control Board, which cited the need to protect young people from developing gambling addictions.

The new law will go into effect on October 1, and it will apply to all gambling activities in the state, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. It is not yet clear how the age increase will be enforced, but violators could face fines or misdemeanor charges.

Nevada is not the first state to raise its gambling age; a number of other states have done so in recent years. In fact, the majority of states have a gambling age of 21 or higher. But Nevada is one of only a few states with a legal gambling age below 21.

The decision to raise the gambling age has been met with mixed reactions. Some people say that it is necessary to protect young people from developing addictions, while others argue that it is unfair to prevent adults from making their own choices.

Whatever your opinion on the matter, it is clear that Nevada is taking action in response to public concerns about gambling addiction. If you are a resident of Nevada, be sure to familiarize yourself with the new law and make sure that you are of legal age before engaging in any gambling activities.

#  Nevada Moves to Increase its Gambling Age

Governor Brian Sandoval has issued a statement in response to a bill passed by the Nevada State Assembly that would increase the gambling age from 18 to 21. The statement reads,

"I am pleased that the legislature has acted to address concerns I voiced about the potential impact of SB 201 on our state's economy. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that this important legislation is signed into law."

Senator James Settelmeyer, who sponsored SB 201, says that he introduced the bill because "the youth of our state are more vulnerable to gambling addiction."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will hurt business at Nevada's casinos and tribal gaming facilities. They also maintain that adults age 18 and older are capable of making responsible decisions about gambling.

#  Nevada Considers a Raise in the Minimum Gambling Age

Nevada lawmakers are currently considering a proposal that would raise the minimum gambling age in the state from 18 to 21. The measure, which was introduced by Assemblyman Ira Hansen earlier this year, is currently making its way through the legislative process and has received strong support from both lawmakers and casino operators.

If passed, the measure would make Nevada one of only a few states in the country with a minimum gambling age of 21. In most states, the minimum gambling age is either 18 or 19 years old.

Supporters of the measure argue that it would help protect young people from developing gambling addictions. They also argue that it would help reduce underage gambling losses at casinos.

Opponents of the measure, on the other hand, argue that it would negatively impact tourism in Nevada. They claim that young people are an important part of the tourism industry and that increasing the minimum gambling age would discourage them from visiting casinos.

The fate of the measure is still uncertain, but lawmakers are expected to vote on it in the near future.

#  Nevada Mulls a Change in Minimum Gambling Age

In Nevada, lawmakers are considering a proposal to increase the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21. If the bill is passed, it would make Nevada one of just a few states with a minimum gambling age of 21.

The measure, which was introduced by Assemblyman James Ohrenschall, would not apply to casinos, but would cover all other types of gambling, including state lotteries, bingo games, and poker tournaments.

Supporters of the proposal say that it would help protect young people from addiction to gambling. They note that the brain is not fully developed until people reach the age of 21, and that young people are more likely to become addicted to gambling than adults.

Opponents of the proposal argue that it would unfairly punish responsible adults who are old enough to vote and serve in the military. They also say that it would be difficult to enforce and could lead to more underage gambling.

The bill has yet to be voted on by the Nevada legislature, but if it is approved, it would take effect on January 1, 2020.
