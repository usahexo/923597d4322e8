#  Yankees and Red Sox Battle for AL East Crown

The Yankees and Red Sox are in a battle for the AL East crown. The Yankees are currently in first place, but the Red Sox are not too far behind.

The Yankees have been led by their strong offense. They have scored the most runs in the American League and they are hitting .262 as a team. Aaron Judge has been one of the main contributors to their offense. He is currently leading the league with 33 home runs and 97 RBIs. Gary Sanchez has also been a big contributor, hitting .274 with 21 home runs and 52 RBIs.

The Red Sox have been led by their pitching staff. They have the best ERA in the American League at 3.44. Chris Sale has been their ace, going 12-4 with a 2.11 ERA. David Price has also been solid, going 9-6 with a 4.08 ERA.

These two teams are evenly matched and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.

#  Orioles and Blue Jays Battle for Third Place

Baltimore and Toronto are both in pursuit of a wild card spot, but they are also battling for third place in the AL East. The Orioles currently hold the third place spot by one game over the Blue Jays.

The Orioles have had an up-and-down season. They started off the year hot, but have since cooled off. The Blue Jays have had a similar season; they started off slow but have been playing better lately.

Toronto has some of the best players in baseball, including Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista. Baltimore also has some good players, including Manny Machado and Chris Davis.

Both teams are looking to clinch a playoff berth, but they are also fighting for positioning in the AL East standings. These two teams will likely continue to battle until the end of the season.

#  Tampa Bay Rays in Fourth Place, but Still in the Race

The Tampa Bay Rays find themselves in fourth place in the AL East division as of June 1, but they are still very much in the race.

The Rays started the season slowly, but they have been playing much better lately. They have won six of their last ten games, and they are just four games out of first place.

The Rays have one of the best starting rotations in baseball. They have three aces in Chris Archer, Blake Snell, and Tyler Glasnow. They also have two very good starters in Yonny Chirinos and Nathan Eovaldi.

Their bullpen is also very good. The back end of the bullpen features All-Star closer Brad Boxberger and setup man Diego Castillo.

The Rays also have a very good offense. They are led by Evan Longoria, who is having a bounce-back season. Logan Morrison, Corey Dickerson, and Steven Souza Jr. are also key contributors to the offense.

Despite being in fourth place, the Rays are still very much alive in the playoff race. They will need to continue to play well in order to catch up to the first-place New York Yankees.

#  Boston Red Sox Clinch AL East Division Title

The Boston Red Sox clinched their ninth AL East division title on September 20, 2018 with a thrilling come-from-behind victory over the New York Yankees. The Sox entered the game trailing by three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, but they rallied to win 5-4 on a walk-off home run by Jackie Bradley Jr.

This was a great team victory for the Red Sox, as every player in their lineup contributed at least one hit or run. The win also capped off an amazing comeback season for Boston, who finished the year with a 108-54 record after losing consecutive games to the Oakland Athletics on September 18 and 19.

Boston will now shift its focus to the upcoming playoffs, where they will face division rival Cleveland Indians in the first round. The Red Sox are heavy favorites to reach the World Series, and they will certainly be looking to return to baseball’s biggest stage after being eliminated in last year’s ALDS.

#  New York Yankees Earn Wild Card Berth

The New York Yankees have clinched a wild card berth in the American League. The Bronx Bombers will face the Minnesota Twins in the one-game playoff at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night.

The Yankees were cruising along until the month of August, when they went just 14-14. However, they rebounded in September to finish with an 88-74 record.

Minnesota was one of the surprise teams in baseball this season. The Twins won 85 games and captured the second AL wild card berth.

Tuesday's game should be a good one. Both teams are veteran clubs that know how to win. The Yankees have sluggers like Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, while the Twins have Ervin Santana and Jose Berrios pitching well this season.

Whoever wins on Tuesday night will advance to the AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians.
