#  New Memory Trick for Remembering the Order of Poker Hands 

The order of poker hands can be a little tricky to remember, but with this new memory trick you'll have it down in no time!

1. Start by thinking of a familiar object, like a tree.
2. Now, associate each poker hand with a part of the tree. 
3. The first hand is the root of the tree, followed by the trunk, then the branches, and finally the leaves.
4. Practice saying each hand out loud as you picture it in your head. 
5. You'll be a pro in no time!

Here's an example: imagine you're looking at a big oak tree. The root is at the bottom of the tree, followed by the trunk, then the branches, and finally the leaves on top. If you were to say the hands out loud as you pictured them, it would sound something like this: "Ace of Spades is at the bottom of the tree as the root, Two of Clubs is at the top of the trunk, Three of Diamonds is in one of the branches, and Four of Hearts is in another branch."

#  How to Remember the Order of Poker Hands in 30 Seconds 

Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 is the order of poker hands from best to worst. In general, the higher the card rank, the better the hand. So an Ace high hand would be ranked higher than a two high hand.

There are a few exceptions to this rule: for example, two pairs (two different rank cards like two eights or two queens) are always better than a single high card. Here’s a list of all the different types of poker hands, ranked from best to worst:

1) Royal flush – This is the best possible hand in poker and consists of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10 all of the same suit.

2) Straight flush – A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥.

3) Four of a kind – This is four cards of the same rank. For example, four kings or four aces.

4) Full house – This is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, three sevens and two twos would be a full house.

5) Flush – This is five cards of the same suit but not in consecutive order. For example, nine hearts, six spades, three clubs would be a flush.

6) Straight – This is five consecutive cards not all of the same suit. For example, nine diamonds, eight spades, seven hearts would be a straight.

7) Three of a kind – This is three cards of the same rank plus two unrelated side cards. For example, three queens and two jacks would be three of a kind. 
8) Two pair – This hand has two different pairs of ranks plus one unrelated side card. An example would be two tens and two sixes as well as an ace kicker).  9) One pair – This hand has just one pair (of any rank).  10) High card – If you don’t have any other poker hands mentioned here then your highest ranking card becomes your “high card”).

#  The Memory Trick You Need to Memorize the Poker Hand Rankings 

There are 40 different poker hand rankings, each one more powerful than the last. If you want to be a successful poker player, you need to know them off by heart.

It can be tricky to remember all of them, but there is a memory trick that can help.

The trick is to use a story to remember the hands. Here's an example:

Think of a lion walking through the jungle. He comes across a snake, and the snake has seven heads. The lion kills the snake and takes its seven golden rings.

Now, let's apply this story to poker hands. The lion is Ace King, the jungle is 2-10, the snake is Queen Jack and the rings are all the different types of poker hands (pair, two pair, etc).

This story should help you remember the rankings like this: Aces are the strongest, then lions, then snakes, then rings. As you work your way down the list, each hand becomes weaker than the one before it.

#  A Quick Trick for Memorizing the Poker Hand Rankings 

When you’re playing poker, it’s important to know what the rank of the different hands are. This way, you can make sure you’re not holding a hand that’s lower in value than the cards your opponents are holding. 

While there are plenty of ways to learn and remember the hand rankings, one of the easiest is to use a simple mnemonic trick.

All you have to do is come up with a funny story involving someone with each of the hands ranked from high to low. For example, here’s one for Royal Flush: 

A young woman named Alice was on a first date with a man named Alex. She was really nervous, but she tried not to show it. The date went really well, and by the end of the night they were both really attracted to each other. As they were getting ready to say goodbye, Alex leaned in for a kiss… and Alice accidentally blushed right in his face!
