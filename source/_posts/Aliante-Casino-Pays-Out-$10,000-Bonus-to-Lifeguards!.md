#  Aliante Casino Pays Out $10,000 Bonus to Lifeguards!

The towering Aliante Casino resort in North Las Vegas has been a hub of activity since it’s opening back in 2008. Just this past weekend, the casino made headlines yet again as they rewarded a group of diligent lifeguards with a $10,000 bonus!

The casino’s general manager, Bob Stupak, was so impressed with the group’s hard work that he decided to present them with the hefty sum. The lifeguards had been working around the clock to keep swimmers safe in the casino’s pool, and Stupak felt that they deserved some extra spending money.

In his statement, Stupak said that “it was great to be able to reward these employees for their hard work and dedication. Without them, our pool wouldn’t be nearly as safe as it is.”

The lifeguards were obviously ecstatic about their bonus, and wasted no time in cashing it in at the casino’s lavish gift shop. It just goes to show that when it comes to casinos, big payouts are always possible!

#  Aliante Casino Swears in New Lifeguards with $10,000 Bonuses!

The Aliante Casino has just announced a new initiative to promote lifeguarding among its staff. Starting immediately, any new employee who completes an American Red Cross lifeguard certification will be awarded a $10,000 bonus.

Aliante Casino Vice President of Operations David Hinkle had this to say about the new program: "We take the safety of our guests and employees seriously and are committed to providing the highest level of security possible. We're excited to offer this bonus to our team members who complete lifeguard certification, and we hope that it will encourage more people to become lifesavers."

This announcement comes in the wake of several high-profile drownings in Southern Nevada, including one at the Aliante Casino's own pool. In light of these tragedies, the casino is hoping to increase the number of lifeguards on duty by offering this lucrative incentive.

The American Red Cross offers several different lifeguard certifications, including Lifeguarding/First Aid/CPR/AED, Lifeguard Instructor, Water Safety Instructor (WSI), and Professional Rescuer CPR/AED. The $10,000 bonus will be awarded to any employee who completes any one of these certifications.

The Aliante Casino isn't the only business in Las Vegas to offer incentives for lifesaving certification. The Bellagio Resort & Casino offers its employees up to $5,000 for completing their WSI certification. And MGM Resorts International recently announced that all of its employees will be offered free CPR training.

With summer coming into full swing, now is a great time for businesses and individuals alike to invest in lifesaving certification. For more information on American Red Cross lifeguard certifications, visit redcrosslasvegas.org or call 702-733-2767.

#  Aliante Casino Awards $10,000 Bonuses to New Lifeguards!

In response to the recent heatwave in the Las Vegas valley, Aliante Casino has decided to award $10,000 bonuses to their new lifeguards. The casino’s general manager, Todd Greenberg, made the announcement earlier this week.

“We appreciate the hard work that our lifeguards put in every day and want to do what we can to thank them,” Greenberg said in a statement. “With temperatures reaching well over 100 degrees recently, it’s important that we have people on duty who are able to keep our guests safe.”

The $10,000 bonuses will be awarded to 15 new lifeguards who have been with the casino for less than a year. In addition to the bonus, each lifeguard will also receive a special certificate of appreciation from Aliante Casino.

This news comes as a relief to many local residents, who have been struggling with the extreme heat over the past few weeks. With temperatures reaching 108 degrees on Monday, locals are looking for any way they can stay cool and safe.

“I think it’s great that Aliante Casino is awarding these bonuses,” said local resident Sharon Frohnen. “It really shows how much they care about their employees and their guests. I know I feel a lot safer knowing that these lifeguards are on duty at the casino.”

#  Aliante Casino bets big on its new lifeguards, awarding $10,000 bonuses

In an effort to reduce its high employee turnover rate, Aliante Casino has announced that it will be awarding $10,000 bonuses to its new lifeguards. The casino is hoping that the extra cash will help to keep its pool staff on board and improve service for its guests.

Aliante Casino isn’t the only business in town to recognize the importance of lifeguards. Just last month, the city of Las Vegas awarded $10,000 bonuses to 15 new lifeguards. The city is in the process of hiring an additional 100 lifeguards to help keep up with the growing demand for their services.

With summer temperatures hovering around 110 degrees, it’s no surprise that Las Vegas is experiencing a surge in tourism. Hotel occupancy rates are currently at 95 percent and are expected to rise even further as we enter into the peak season. This increased demand has put a strain on both the city’s infrastructure and its workforce.

Las Vegas currently employs close to 500 lifeguards, but with temperatures on the rise, that number is likely not going to be enough. That’s why the city is stepping up its recruitment efforts and offering $10,000 bonuses to anyone who can pass its challenging lifeguard certification exam.

The exam covers everything from first aid and CPR to aquatic rescues and disaster management. It’s one of the most rigorous exams in the country, but it’s also one of the most rewarding. As a certified lifeguard, you can expect to make upwards of $15 per hour working at some of Las Vegas’ top resorts and casinos.
