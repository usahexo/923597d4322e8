#  Graham Greene: How Much Is The Tulalip Casino Buffet?

Graham Greene is a very successful author, and once said, "The greatest happiness you can have is knowing that you do not necessarily require happiness." He was born in 1904 and died in 1991. Greene was baptized a Catholic, but became an atheist early in life. That said, he has been quoted as saying, "I am not sure that I disbelieve in God. I cannot prove that He does not exist, but I am equally unable to prove that He does." With a mind like that, it's no wonder Greene wrote some of the most famous novels of the 20th century.

One of Greene's most well-known works is the novel "The Power and the Glory." It tells the story of a priest who is on the run from the law during Mexico's Cristero War. The book was published in 1940 and was very controversial due to its sympathetic portrayal of a priest who is considered by some to be a criminal. The book was banned in several countries, but it won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1941.

Greene's other famous works include "The Heart of the Matter" (1948), "Our Man In Havana" (1958), and "The Quiet American" (1955). He also wrote several plays, including "The Living Room" (1953) and "Travels with My Aunt" (1972).

Greene was known for his unique writing style, which often blurred the lines between fact and fiction. He was also known for his pessimistic worldview and his use of symbolism in his work. In fact, many consider him to be one of the most important authors of the 20th century.

Despite his success as an author, Greene never fully embraced his fame. He often shunned interviews and refused to do book signings. In fact, he once said, "It is fatal to be a saintâ€¦you must always be yourself."
