#  Orioles looking to make a run this postseason, and here's how you can cash in!

Baltimore Orioles fans have had a lot to cheer about over the past two seasons. The Birds advanced to the playoffs in 2014 and 2015, although they were eliminated in the Wild Card game both times. This season, expectations are high and Orioles fans are hoping their team can make a deep run in the playoffs.

If you're looking to bet on the Orioles this postseason, here are three tips that can help you cash in:

1) Focus on their hitting.

The Orioles' offense is one of their strengths. They rank second in the American League in runs scored, and they have a number of dangerous hitters, including Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Jonathan Schoop. This makes them a dangerous team to bet on, especially when they're playing at home.

2) Don't underestimate their bullpen.

The Orioles bullpen has been underrated this season. Led by Zach Britton (who leads the American League with 47 saves), their bullpen is one of the best in baseball. This could be key down the stretch and in the playoffs.

3) Look for value bets.

Not all Orioles games are created equal. There can be some good value bets available if you look closely enough. For example, Baltimore is a -160 favorite against Toronto on Tuesday, but they may be worth backing at those odds considering how well they've been playing lately.

#  Baltimore Orioles offer some of the best odds in baseball - here's how to win

The Baltimore Orioles had a surprisingly successful 2017 season, finishing second in the American League East with a record of 89-73. Manager Buck Showalter deserves much of the credit for the team's resurgence, as he has a well-deserved reputation for getting the most out of his players.

The Orioles will be looking to build on their success from last season, and they offer some of the best odds in baseball to do so. If you're looking to put some money on them, here are three ways to do it.

1. Bet on Manny Machado to win the MVP Award

Manny Machado is one of the best players in baseball, and he's coming off a season in which he hit 33 home runs and batted .282. He'll be looking to build on that success this year, and there's a good chance he'll be named MVP at the end of the season. The Orioles are offering odds of 12/1 at most sportsbooks that he will win the MVP Award. That's a great value bet, so make sure to include it in your betting portfolio.

2. Bet on the Orioles to win the AL East

The Orioles are one of the favorites to win the AL East this year, and they're currently being offered odds of 5/1 at most sportsbooks. That's a great value bet, as they have an excellent chance of winning the division. Led by Buck Showalter and an explosive lineup led by Manny Machado, they're poised for another successful season.

3. Bet on Chris Davis to lead the league in Home Runs

Chris Davis is one of the top power hitters in baseball, and he's coming off a season in which he hit 38 home runs and batted .215. He'll be looking to improve on those numbers this year, and there's a good chance he'll lead the league in home runs at the end of the season. The Orioles are offering odds of 10/1 at most sportsbooks that Davis will lead the league in home runs. That's another great value bet, so make sure to include it in your betting portfolio.
