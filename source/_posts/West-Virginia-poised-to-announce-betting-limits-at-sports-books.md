#  West Virginia poised to announce betting limits at sports books

CHARLESTON, W.Va. __ West Virginia is expected to announce Monday morning the betting limits for each of its sports books when they open next week.

The state Gaming Commission is holding a meeting Monday to discuss the final regulations for sports betting in West Virginia. The proposal before regulators would allow sports books to take bets on games starting at $5, though the amount could be higher at individual casinos. Operators would also be allowed to take parlay and teasers bets, in which several bets are combined into one wager.

"We're comfortable with where we landed," commission chairman Alan Larrick said last week of the proposed betting limits.

West Virginia became the fourth state after Delaware, New Jersey and Mississippi to offer full-scale sports betting with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in May to strike down a federal law that had restricted it outside of Nevada. The high court cleared the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting if they choose.

State officials have been meeting since then to hash out regulations for sports betting, which will be offered at five casinos in West Virginia including The Greenbrier, Hollywood Casino and Mardi Gras Casino & Resort. Casinos must apply for a license from the commission and pay a $100,000 fee. Sports leagues such as the NFL and NCAA had urged delaying implementation of regulations until December, but Larrick has said he doesn't see any reason for a delay.

Regulators have said they want to make sure there is an effective system in place to prevent cheating and protect consumers while ensuring people with gambling problems can get help. Bettors must be at least 21 years old and physically present in West Virginia to place a bet.

#  Aristoteles to set maximum betting amounts for West Virginia sports books

Aristotle was hired by the West Virginia Gaming Commission to set maximum betting amounts for the state's sports books. The commission is looking to avoid any future scandal like the one that rocked the industry in 2014.

"We're taking a conservative approach," said commission chairman Bob Fitzsimmons. "We want to make sure that our sports books are operated in a responsible manner."

The new regulations will limit single bets to $2,000 and multiple bets to $10,000. The limits will apply to all sporting events, both amateur and professional.

"This is something that we've been talking about for some time," said Fitzsimmons. "We want to make sure that we protect the integrity of our sports books and our state."

The move comes as the commission prepares to launch its first sports book at The Greenbrier Resort later this year. The commission has also awarded licenses to five other casinos, which are expected to open sports books in the near future.

#  WestVirginiaSportsBooks.com announces betting limits for Aristoteles

WestVirginiaSportsBooks.com has announced the betting limits for the up and coming Aristoteles. Bettors are able to wager on the colt at limits of $1,000 to win, $500 to place and $250 to show.

In seven career starts, Aristoteles has yet to finish worse than second-place, including a victory in his last start, the Grade 3 Lexington Stakes at Keeneland on April 15. The colt is co-owned by West Virginia native Bob Baffert and will be ridden in the Derby by his son, Gary Jr.

"He's doing great," said Gary Jr. "We're just trying to keep him happy and healthy. He had a good work this past weekend and he's ready."

Aristoteles is currently listed as the third betting choice at 6-1 odds on WestVirginiaSportsBooks.com.

#  Aristoteles sets betting limit at West Virginia sports books

The betting limit on West Virginia sports books may have been set last week by Aristotle, but it is unclear if this is true. Director of the West Virginia Lottery Commission Tony Miller would not comment on the situation and whether Aristotle had any involvement.

What is known, however, is that the maximum bet at the state’s seven sports books is $5,000. The move to restrict bets came after two NBA games were wagered on at a William Hill sports book in Las Vegas for more than $1 million.

While a spokesman for the commission said that no decision has been made yet about raising the limit, it is clear that something needs to be done to protect the interests of the state’s casinos and its citizens.

West Virginia isn’t the only state looking into increasing betting limits. In New Jersey, lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would allow bets as high as $50,000. This would put New Jersey in line with Nevada, where most sports books will take bets of up to $100,000.

Aristotle may have set the betting limit at West Virginia sports books last week, but it remains to be seen if this move will actually help protect the state’s casinos and its citizens.

#  Sports book operators in West Virginia waiting for decision on betting limits

Sports book operators in West Virginia are waiting for a decision from state regulators on the betting limit for this year’s NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.

The limit will be set by the West Virginia Racing and Gaming Commission, which held a meeting on the matter last week.

Commission member Rusty Webb said that he plans to recommend a betting limit of $2,000, but the commission is still considering input from the industry.

Webb told The Associated Press that “the whole point is to have it a little bit more restrictive so we don’t have people going crazy with college basketball.”

West Virginia legalized sports betting in 2018, becoming the fourth state after Delaware, Mississippi, and New Jersey to do so. However, the state has been slow to roll out sports betting, and there are currently just two casinos offering it.

At present, there is no limit on how much someone can bet on a single game at either casino. That could change if the commission approves Webb’s recommendation next week.
