#  What is the game bet in Spain? 

The game bet, also known as "la partida", is a popular card game in Spain. It is typically played by four players in two partnerships. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking tricks and melding cards.

The deck of cards used for the game Bet consists of 40 cards divided equally into 4 suits: coins, cups, swords and clubs. There are 10 cards in each suit, from ace (high) to ten (low). In addition, there are 4 jokers which are wild cards.

Each player is dealt 10 cards, one at a time. The remaining card is placed face down in the centre of the table to form the stock pile. The player to the left of the dealer begins play and the turn passes clockwise.

On a player's turn, they must do one of three things: draw one card from the stock pile and add it to their hand; take all the cards from the stock pile and place them face down in front of them forming a new stock pile; or play a card from their hand.

When playing a card, the rank of the card determines its value. The ace is high and the two is low. Suits are not important and there are no trump cards. If two or more players play a card of the same rank, then the highest card wins (the ace is higher than the king). The winner of the trick takes all of the played cards and sets them aside, face down.

If a player cannot play any more cards from their hand, they must draw one card from either the stock pile or anywhere else in order to have another card to play. When there are no more cards left in either the stock pile or players' hands, that player's turn ends and it passes to the next player on their left.

The first player to run out of cards loses and their opponent(s) score(s) one point for each card remaining in that player's hand at end of play (the opposing team will also score any melded sets or sequences comprising those final held cards). The game continues until one partnership reaches or exceeds 11 points; at which point that team wins the game (or earlier if one team reaches 21 points).

#  How do you play the Slingo game?

The Slingo game is played by matching numbers on a 5-by-5 grid. The game starts with the player being dealt 11 cards. Five of these cards are displayed in the grid, and the player must match the numbers on these cards to the numbers in the grid. When a match is made, the number is crossed off the grid, and a new card is dealt to replace it. If all of the numbers are crossed off the grid, then the player wins. If no matches can be made, then the player loses.

The game can also be played in reverse mode, where the player tries to remove as many numbers from the grid as possible. In this mode, matches can be made either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
