#  Precisely What Is PKo Poker Bundesliga? 

PKo Poker Bundesliga, also called PKo for short, is a poker league that was founded in 2017. PKo Poker Bundesliga operates like most other professional poker leagues with players qualifying for tournaments through a variety of means before competing in a season-long tournament series. The main difference between PKo Poker Bundesliga and other leagues, however, is that PKo features an unconventional poker variant known as Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO).

In order to participate in PKo Poker Bundesliga events, players must first become members of the league. Membership is open to anyone over the age of 18 and costs €10 per month. Players can then qualify for tournaments in a variety of ways, such as by winning online qualifiers or through live feeder tournaments. The main event of the season is the €100,000 GTD Championship which takes place over three days at a casino in Germany.

PKo Poker Bundesliga is run by Michael Keiner and Stefan Schillhabel, two of the most accomplished PLO players in the world. Both men are passionate about promoting PLO and believe that PKo offers an exciting and competitive environment for players of all skill levels.

#  What Can You Anticipate In The PKo Poker Bundesliga? 

Just days ago, it was announced that the very first Poker Bundesliga would start up from the month of January onward. Just what can participants anticipate in the inaugural season? 

For one, the competitions will be divided into two categories: Regular and Knockout. Players who finish in the top four of the Regular division will automatically progress into the Knockout division, while players who finish in last place will be eliminated from the league. 

In terms of prizes, there is a total of €10,000 on offer which will be distributed among the top eight players at the end of the season. The winner will walk away with €2,500, while second and third place finishers will receive €1,500 and €1,000 respectively.
