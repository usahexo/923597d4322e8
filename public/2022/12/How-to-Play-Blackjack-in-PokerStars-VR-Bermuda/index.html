<p>First, open the PokerStars VR lobby, and find the blackjack table. There are six seats at the table, so select the seat that you want to occupy. The dealer will then deal two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over.</p>
<p>To start play, click on your cards to select them. You can then hit (draw another card), stand (stick with the current total), double down (double your bet and receive one more card), or split (split a hand of two cards of equal value into two separate hands). If you go over 21, your hand is busted and you lose automatically.</p>
<p>The dealer must draw until they have at least 17 points, and must stand on all totals of 17 or higher. The player always has the option of hitting or standing, no matter what their total is. When both players have finished playing their hands, the dealer reveals their second card and compares their total to the players’. The highest total wins the hand, and if there is a tie, the player with the most points on their first card wins.</p>
<h1 id="Precisely-How-to-Play-Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda"><a href="#Precisely-How-to-Play-Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda" class="headerlink" title="Precisely How to Play Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda"></a>Precisely How to Play Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda</h1><p>A detailed guide on how to play blackjack at PokerStars VR Bermuda. This game can be found in the Poker VR lobby under the “Casino Games” tab.</p>
<p>To begin, select “Blackjack” from the Casino Games menu. You will then be taken to a table where you can choose your bet size and whether you want to play against the computer or other players.</p>
<p>To place a bet, click on the chips at the bottom of the screen and select the amount you would like to bet. Then, click on the table where you would like to place your chip.</p>
<p>Your goal is to have a higher score than the dealer, without going over 21. The cards are worth their face value, with Jacks, Queens and Kings counting as 10 points, and Aces counting as 1 or 11 points.</p>
<p>To hit (take another card), click on the Hit button below your hand. To stand (stop taking cards), click on Stand. If you go over 21, you lose automatically - known as “busting”.</p>
<p>The dealer will also draw cards until they reach 17 or above. If the dealer goes over 21, all players still in the game win automatically.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda-The-Precise-Strategy"><a href="#Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda-The-Precise-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda: The Precise Strategy"></a>Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda: The Precise Strategy</h1><p>Bermuda is an isolated island country located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the smallest countries in the world, both in geographical size and population. Despite its small size, Bermuda is an important global financial center. And now, it’s also home to one of the most interesting new virtual reality poker rooms: PokerStars VR Bermuda.</p>
<p>PokerStars VR Bermuda is a surprisingly realistic experience. You can walk around the virtual room, chat with other players, and even take a break outside on the patio to get some fresh air. The gameplay itself is also very realistic, thanks to the use of state-of-the-art motion tracking technology.</p>
<p>Bermuda is a no-limit Texas Hold’em poker room, and the stakes range from penny games up to $10/20 No Limit. There’s a good variety of tables available, so you’re sure to find one that fits your skill level and budget.</p>
<p>If you’re new to PokerStars VR Bermuda, or just want to brush up on your skills, then check out this guide to the precise strategy for playing blackjack in this room.</p>
<p>The basic strategy for blackjack in any casino is pretty simple: Just try to draw as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand by doing so. This strategy works fine in most casinos, but it doesn’t take into account the unusual rules of PokerStars VR Bermuda.</p>
<p>In PokerStars VR Bermuda, Aces are worth 1 point and all other cards are worth their face value. There are no bonus payouts for blackjacks or any other hand combination. The only thing that matters is whether you beat the dealer’s hand or not.</p>
<p>With these rules in mind, here’s the precise blackjack strategy for PokerStars VR Bermuda:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always stand on 17 or higher. In this game, it’s better to risk going bust than risk losing by having a lower score than the dealer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have 16 or less, hit if the dealer has 2 through 6 showing. Hit if the dealer has 8 or 9 showing (this gives you a better chance of getting closer to 21 without going over). Stand if the dealer has 7 or 10 showing (these are likely pat hands).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Double down on 11 only (unless the dealer has an Ace showing, in which case hit). doubling down gives you a chance to win more money with a good hand, but remember that you’ll have to risk losing everything if things go wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs (except 10s) if both cards have equal value. This gives you two chances at winning instead of one. For example, if you’re dealt two 8s then split them and play each card as if it were an individual hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer has an Ace showing (as part of their first two cards), then always take insurance*. This protects your bet against losing big if the dealer gets Blackjack - which they will do about 1 in 4 times when they have an Ace upcard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> *Note: Insurance costs half of your original bet amount, so it’s not always worth taking it even if the dealer is heavily favored to get blackjack</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Blackjack-Like-a-Pro-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda"><a href="#How-to-Play-Blackjack-Like-a-Pro-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro in PokerStars VR Bermuda"></a>How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro in PokerStars VR Bermuda</h1><p>In this article, you will learn how to play Blackjack like a pro in PokerStars VR Bermuda.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>In order to play Blackjack like a pro, you first need to get started by opening up PokerStars VR and selecting the “Bermuda” game mode. Once you’re in the game, you will need to select a table and then click on the “Open Card Deck” button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. This will bring up the card deck, which you can then use to start playing Blackjack.</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics-of-Blackjack"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Blackjack"></a>The Basics of Blackjack</h2><p>Blackjack is a card game that is played between two players - the player and the dealer. The objective of the game is for the player to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on their first two cards (called a “natural”), or by scoring more points than the dealer without going over 21. In order to achieve this, players must first draw cards from the deck and then choose whether to “hit” (draw another card), “stand” (stick with what they have), or “double down” (double their bet and receive just one more card).</p>
<h2 id="Playing-Like-a-Pro"><a href="#Playing-Like-a-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Playing Like a Pro"></a>Playing Like a Pro</h2><p>Now that you know the basics of Blackjack, it’s time to start playing like a pro. Firstly, always remember that it’s important not to go over 21 points - if you do, you automatically lose the hand. Secondly, try not to hit on low cards (2-6) as this is more likely to result in you going over 21 points. Instead, try standing on these hands or doubling down if you have a strong hand. Lastly, remember that it’s important to keep track of what the dealer is doing - if they are showing low cards, it might be worth taking some risks and hitting on your own hand in order to beat them.</p>
<h1 id="The-Perfect-Way-to-Play-Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda"><a href="#The-Perfect-Way-to-Play-Blackjack-in-PokerStars-VR-Bermuda" class="headerlink" title="The Perfect Way to Play Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda"></a>The Perfect Way to Play Blackjack in PokerStars VR Bermuda</h1><p>Using a 3-6 betting spread and basic strategy, you can optimize your winning chances when playing blackjack in the PokerStars VR game.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics-of-Blackjack-in-VR"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Blackjack-in-VR" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Blackjack in VR"></a>The Basics of Blackjack in VR</h1><p>The basic premise of blackjack is to have a hand total that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand total, without going over 21. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points, and an Ace can be either 1 or 11 points. If your hand total exceeds 21 points then you bust and automatically lose the hand.</p>
<p>In VR blackjack you will be playing against the dealer only, there are no other players at the table. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand total without busting. You can either hit (draw another card) or stand (end your turn). You can also double down (double your bet and receive one more card), split (if you are dealt two cards of the same value you can split them into two separate hands) or insurance (insurance bets are placed when the dealer has an Ace showing).</p>
<h1 id="Card-Values-in-VR-Blackjack"><a href="#Card-Values-in-VR-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Card Values in VR Blackjack"></a>Card Values in VR Blackjack</h1><p>In PokerStars VR blackjack all card values are displayed as their face value except for Aces which are displayed as 1 or 11 as appropriate. For example, if you have a 7 and a 4 in your hand then the total would be 11 (7 + 4 = 11). If the dealer has an Ace showing then they have a potential total of either 12 or 16 points (1 + 5 + 10 = 16, or 2 + 4 = 12). In this instance if you were to take insurance then your insurance bet would win if the dealer’s second card was a 10-point card, as this would make their hand total 22 points which would bust.</p>
<h1 id="Basic-Strategy-for-Blackjack-in-VR"><a href="#Basic-Strategy-for-Blackjack-in-VR" class="headerlink" title="Basic Strategy for Blackjack in VR"></a>Basic Strategy for Blackjack in VR</h1><p>When playing blackjack in VR it is best to use a 3-6 betting spread. This means that you should always bet 3x or 6x your original bet amount on each turn depending on what is available on the table. For example, if the table minimum stake is $1 then you should bet $3 on each turn ($1 original bet plus $2 increase). This will minimise your losses when you do eventually bust and gives you good chances of winning when your hands match up with those of the dealer.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to play blackjack using a basic strategy we need to understand when it is best to hit, stand etc. To help with this we can use some simple rules:</p>
<p>If your hand totals between 12 and 16 points then hit . If your hand totals between 17 and 21 points then stand . If the dealer has an Ace showing then hit if your hand totals between 12 and 16 points . Otherwise stand .</p>
