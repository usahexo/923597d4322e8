        <h1 id="Curry-and-Durant-Lead-Warriors-to-Another-Victory"><a href="#Curry-and-Durant-Lead-Warriors-to-Another-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Curry and Durant Lead Warriors to Another Victory"></a>Curry and Durant Lead Warriors to Another Victory</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors (GSW) continue to dominate the NBA with their latest victory against the Detroit Pistons. The GSW’s are now on a nine-game winning streak and show no signs of slowing down. Led by Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, the Warriors were able to pull out a 117-106 victory.</p>
<p>Curry led all scorers with 28 points while Durant chipped in 27 points of his own. Andre Iguodala was also impressive off the bench, scoring 19 points in just over 20 minutes of play. The Warriors were able to take control of the game in the second quarter, outscoring the Pistons 34-21.</p>
<p>The GSW’s currently have the best record in the NBA, as well as being first in offensive rating (119.7) and defensive rating (97.7). With Curry and Durant both carrying MVP-level stats, it is hard to imagine any other team coming close to beating them this season.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors-Win-Third-Game-in-a-Row"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors-Win-Third-Game-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors Win Third Game in a Row"></a>Golden State Warriors Win Third Game in a Row</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors beat the Denver Nuggets with a final score of 116-108. This is their third consecutive win and they are now 7-2 for the season. Stephen Curry had 28 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while Kevin Durant added 27 points. Klay Thompson scored 20 points and Draymond Green recorded 10 assists to help secure the victory.</p>
<p>The Warriors were without their big man, DeMarcus Cousins, who is out with an Achilles injury. Coach Steve Kerr said before the game that he was impressed with how his players were adapting to playing without Cousins. “They’ve done a great job,” Kerr said. “Our rotations are good. We’re moving the ball well.”</p>
<p>Prior to the game against the Nuggets, Curry was asked about the prospect of becoming the all-time scoring leader for the franchise. “It would be a cool accomplishment,” Curry said. “But at this point it’s more about winning championships and doing something that has never been done before.”</p>
<p>With their win against the Nuggets, the Warriors moved into first place in the Western Conference standings. They will next face off against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Warriors-Cruise-Past-Cavaliers-for-Second-Straight-NBA-Finals-Victory"><a href="#Warriors-Cruise-Past-Cavaliers-for-Second-Straight-NBA-Finals-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Warriors Cruise Past Cavaliers for Second Straight NBA Finals Victory"></a>Warriors Cruise Past Cavaliers for Second Straight NBA Finals Victory</h1><p>In what was a largely one-sided affair, the Golden State Warriors hosted and defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-102 to take a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.<br> Warhorse Kevin Durant led all scorers with 38 points on 14-of-26 shooting, including 4-of-9 from three. Stephen Curry added 34 points on 11-of-22 shooting, and Draymond Green nearly had a triple double with 12 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists. LeBron James led the Cavs with 23 points on 8-of-23 shooting, while Kyrie Irving added 22 points on an efficient 9-of-16 clip. </p>
<p>It was another strong team performance from the Warriors, who have now won their last 15 games overall. They were able to overcome a slow start offensively – they trailed by six early in the second quarter – by locking down defensively and getting contributions from all over the roster. The Cavs simply couldn’t keep up with Durant, Curry, and company in what has quickly become a lopsided matchup. </p>
<p>The series now shifts to Cleveland for Games 3 and 4. If the Warriors can win one of those games – or take both – they will be just one win away from their second consecutive championship and third in four years.</p>
<h1 id="Curry-and-Durant-Combine-for-66-Points-as-Warriors-Take-Down-Rockets-in-Game-4"><a href="#Curry-and-Durant-Combine-for-66-Points-as-Warriors-Take-Down-Rockets-in-Game-4" class="headerlink" title="Curry and Durant Combine for 66 Points as Warriors Take Down Rockets in Game 4"></a>Curry and Durant Combine for 66 Points as Warriors Take Down Rockets in Game 4</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors’ superstar duo of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant came up big on Sunday night, combining for 66 points as the Warriors took a 3-1 series lead with a 116-106 win over the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p>Curry led the way with 35 points, including five three-pointers, while Durant added 31 points on an efficient 11-of-18 shooting. The win was also a bit of revenge for the Warriors, who lost to the Rockets in last year’s Western Conference Finals.</p>
<p>Houston was led by James Harden, who had 29 points and 10 assists, but Chris Paul struggled mightily, shooting just 2-of-11 from the field for eight points.</p>
<p>The Warriors will look to finish off the Rockets in Game 5 on Wednesday night in Houston.</p>
<h1 id="Warriors-Overcome-Slow-Start-to-Earn-Another-Victory-in-NBA-Finals"><a href="#Warriors-Overcome-Slow-Start-to-Earn-Another-Victory-in-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="Warriors Overcome Slow Start to Earn Another Victory in NBA Finals"></a>Warriors Overcome Slow Start to Earn Another Victory in NBA Finals</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors started the game slowly, but they managed to overcome a double-digit deficit to earn a victory in Game 4 of the NBA Finals. This was their fourth consecutive win in the series, and it gave them a 3-1 lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Stephen Curry led the way for the Warriors with 33 points, and he was helped by Kevin Durant (26 points) and Klay Thompson (20 points). Draymond Green also had a big night with 14 rebounds, 10 assists, and six blocks.</p>
<p>LeBron James had another great game for the Cavaliers, finishing with 32 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists. However, no other player on Cleveland scored more than 10 points.</p>
<p>The Warriors will now have a chance to clinch their second straight championship when they host Game 5 on Monday night.</p>
